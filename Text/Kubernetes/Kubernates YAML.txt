Deployment -> ReplicaSet -> POD   ===> Strucher

--------------replication controller  ANd replicaset----------------------------

replication controller is old don't use it use replicaset
replica use replication

=> replica set continue watch any pod is down or not if down then up help of selector because many pods are runing but which app is need to monitor that is mention in this selector.
=> it is optional in replication controller but not in replication set

----------------deployment-----------------
deployment startge 
	 Recreate => Delete All pods and up all new pods (DownTime )
	 Rolling Update => Delete and up One by one  (NO DownTime , Defult startage)


how to do that just change you .yml and run command
kubectl apply -f yml-file.yml   
kubectl apply -f image deployment/myapp-deployment nginx-container=nginx:1.9.1    ==> dereact update image without change in file	 

spec:
  replicas: 3
  strategy:
    type: Recreate/RollingUpdate
